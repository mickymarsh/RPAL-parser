# RPAL Parser

## Overview
The **RPAL Parser** is a Python-based interpreter for the **Right-reference Pedagogic Algorithmic Language (RPAL)**.  
It covers the full process of interpreting RPAL code, from lexical analysis to execution, making it ideal for learning functional programming language implementation.

## Features
- **Lexical Analyzer**: Converts RPAL source code into tokens.  
- **Parser**: Generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens.  
- **Standardizer**: Converts the AST into a standardized form for optimization.  
- **CSE Machine**: Executes the standardized AST, simulating RPAL code execution.
